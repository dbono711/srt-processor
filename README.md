# srt-processor

```srt-processor``` is an interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) application for presenting statistics about SRT flows. It offers the user the ability to either a upload a ```.pcap(ng)``` file containing an SRT session for processing using the [lib-tcpdump-processing](https://github.com/mbakholdina/lib-tcpdump-processing) open source library, or spawn an [srt-live-transmit](https://github.com/Haivision/srt/blob/master/docs/apps/srt-live-transmit.md) process to receive a flow.

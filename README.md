# srt-processor

## Overview

Interactive Streamlit application designed to serve as both a learning environment and a troubleshooting tool for analyzing [Secure Reliable Transport (SRT)](#what-is-srt) flows, enabling users to explore the intricacies of SRT through live streaming sessions.

The application allows content to be received via live SRT streams (as either caller or listener) and analyzed for real-time analysis. Under the hood, the applicaiton is invoking the [srt-live-transmit](https://github.com/Haivision/srt/blob/master/docs/apps/srt-live-transmit.md#command-line-options) application to receive the SRT stream and is using the statistics output from the `srt-live-transmit` application to provide the data for real-time analysis, providing a comprehensive view of SRT statistics.

## Prerequisites

- Docker

## Container Ports

The container exposes the following ports for connectivity:

- (TCP) port 8501 for accessing the Streamlit application
- (UDP) ports 9000-9100 for SRT sessions

## Building the Docker Image Locally

To build the Docker image locally from the Dockerfile included in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/dbono711/srt-processor.git
    cd srt-processor
    ```

2. Build the Docker image:

    ```shell
    docker build -t srt-processor .
    ```

3. Run the Docker container with port forwarding (adjust accordingly for mapping to available ports on your host). Note that the ```--cap-add=NET_ADMIN``` argument is required in order to utilize the network emulation options.

    ```shell
    docker run -d -p 8501:8501/tcp -p 9000-9100:9000-9100/udp --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --name srt-processor srt-processor:latest
    ```

## Pulling the Docker Image from Docker Hub

Alternatively, you can pull the pre-built Docker image from Docker Hub:

1. Pull the Docker image from Docker Hub:

    ```shell
    docker pull dbono711/srt-processor:latest
    ```

2. Run the Docker container with port forwarding (adjust accordingly for mapping to available ports on your host). Note that the ```--cap-add=NET_ADMIN``` argument is required in order to utilize the network emulation options.

    ```shell
    docker run -d -p 8501:8501/tcp -p 9000-9100:9000-9100/udp --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --name srt-processor dbono711/srt-processor:latest
    ```

## Accessing the Application

After starting the Docker container, you can access the Streamlit application by navigating to: ```http://<host ip>:8501```

## Example: Streaming to SRT Processor as a listener

You can use FFmpeg to stream media to the SRT Processor application when it's configured as a listener. Here's an example of how to set up an SRT caller flow to stream video to the application:

1. First, ensure the SRT Processor application is running and configured in Listener mode on the desired port (e.g., 9000).

2. Use the following FFmpeg command to stream a video file to the SRT Processor:

    ```shell
    docker run --rm -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) \
        --name ffmpeg-stream jrottenberg/ffmpeg:4.4-ubuntu \
        -stats \
        -re \
        -i sample_1280x720_surfing_with_audio.mp4 \
        -c:v libx264 -b:v 2500k -g 60 -keyint_min 60 \
        -profile:v main \
        -preset fast \
        -f mpegts "srt://<container-ip>:9000?pkt_size=1316"
    ```

    Replace `<container-ip>` with the IP address of your SRT Processor container, and adjust the input file path as needed.

    Assumes a file named ```sample_1280x720_surfing_with_audio.mp4``` is present in the current directory. Replace with your own file path as needed.

3. Command breakdown:
   - `-stats`: Shows encoding progress statistics
   - `-re`: Reads input at native frame rate (simulates a live source)
   - `-c:v libx264`: Uses H.264 video codec
   - `-b:v 2500k`: Sets video bitrate to 2500 kbps
   - `-g 60 -keyint_min 60`: Sets GOP size and minimum keyframe interval to 60 frames
   - `-profile:v main`: Uses the "main" H.264 profile
   - `-preset fast`: Balances encoding speed and compression efficiency
   - `-f mpegts`: Sets output format to MPEG Transport Stream
   - `pkt_size=1316`: Optimizes SRT packet size for network transmission

4. Once the stream starts, you should see the SRT statistics updating in the SRT Processor web interface.

## Development

This repository includes a [docker-compose.dev.yml](docker-compose.dev.yml) file for creating a consistent and reproducible development environment using Docker Compose.

### Development Prerequisites

## What is SRT?

[Secure Reliable Transport (SRT)](https://github.com/Haivision/srt) is an open-source protocol developed by Haivision in 2012, designed to optimize live video streaming over unpredictable IP networks, particularly the public internet. Released to the industry through the SRT Alliance in 2017, SRT has rapidly become a critical tool for industries like broadcasting, OTT streaming, and enterprise communications. Its core features include low-latency transmission, robust error correction, and end-to-end encryption, making it ideal for secure and reliable live video transport.

SRT leverages Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) and other techniques to ensure high-quality video delivery even over unreliable networks. Its focus on security through 128/256-bit AES encryption ensures that video streams are protected from unauthorized access and tampering. These attributes make SRT highly valuable for live broadcasts, remote production, and cloud-based workflows.

Within the media value chain, SRT plays a key role in both content contribution and distribution, allowing broadcasters to move video from field locations to broadcast centers or cloud platforms with reliability and low latency. Its open-source nature and ability to integrate into IP-based workflows position SRT as a flexible and cost-effective alternative to traditional video transmission methods like satellite, and proprietary protocols such as RTMP and Zixi.

SRTâ€™s rapid adoption by the industry, combined with its scalability and strong performance in challenging network environments, has made it a crucial component in the evolution of digital video broadcasting, particularly as the industry shifts toward cloud-based and IP-driven infrastructures.
